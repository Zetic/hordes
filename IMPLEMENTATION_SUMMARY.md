# Command Interaction Improvements - Implementation Summary

This document describes the changes made to improve command interactions according to issue #126.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure Updates

**bot.ts** - Added autocomplete interaction handling:
- Added `interaction.isAutocomplete()` check in interaction handler
- Calls `command.autocomplete()` method for commands that support it

**bot.ts** - Added inventory use button handling:
- Added handling for buttons with `use_item_` prefix
- Creates mock interaction to execute use command with selected item

### 2. Use Command (/use)

**src/commands/use.ts**:
- ✅ Added `.setAutocomplete(true)` to item parameter
- ✅ Added `autocomplete()` function that shows player's inventory items
- ✅ Filters items based on user input (case insensitive)
- ✅ Shows quantity next to item name in autocomplete suggestions

### 3. Drop Command (/drop)

**src/commands/drop.ts**:
- ✅ Added `.setAutocomplete(true)` to item parameter  
- ✅ Added `autocomplete()` function that shows player's inventory items
- ✅ Filters items based on user input (case insensitive)
- ✅ Shows quantity next to item name in autocomplete suggestions

### 4. Take Command (/take)

**src/commands/take.ts**:
- ✅ Added `.setAutocomplete(true)` to item parameter
- ✅ Added `autocomplete()` function that shows items in current area
- ✅ Only shows suggestions when player is in exploration areas (not city/home)
- ✅ Filters items based on user input (case insensitive)
- ✅ Shows quantity next to item name in autocomplete suggestions

### 5. Bank Command (/bank) - Complete Restructure

**src/commands/bank.ts**:
- ✅ **Removed subcommands** (view/deposit/take)
- ✅ **Added `action` parameter** with choices: deposit, withdraw
- ✅ **Added `item` parameter** with autocomplete support
- ✅ **Default behavior**: `/bank` with no arguments shows bank view (replaces `/bank view`)
- ✅ **Renamed "take" to "withdraw"** for clarity
- ✅ **Smart autocomplete**:
  - For `deposit` action: shows player's inventory items
  - For `withdraw` action: shows bank items
  - For no action: shows no suggestions
- ✅ Updated function names: `handleTakeItem` → `handleWithdrawItem`
- ✅ Updated success messages: "Item Taken" → "Item Withdrawn"

### 6. Inventory Command (/inventory)

**src/commands/inventory.ts**:
- ✅ **Made ephemeral** - inventory display only visible to requesting user
- ✅ **Added interactive use buttons** for each inventory item
- ✅ Buttons are organized in rows (max 5 buttons per row, 5 rows max = 25 items)
- ✅ Each button triggers the use command for the corresponding item
- ✅ Buttons only shown when inventory has items

## Usage Examples

### New Bank Command Usage:
```
/bank                           # Shows bank contents (old: /bank view)
/bank action:deposit item:Wood  # Deposits wood (old: /bank deposit item:Wood)
/bank action:withdraw item:Gold # Withdraws gold (old: /bank take item:Gold)
```

### Autocomplete Behavior:
- Type `/use ban` → suggests "Bandage (x3)", "Banana Split (x2)" 
- Type `/drop w` → suggests "Wood (x10)", "Water (x3)"
- Type `/take st` → suggests "Stick (x2)", "Stone (x5)" (area items)
- Type `/bank action:deposit item:w` → suggests inventory items starting with 'w'
- Type `/bank action:withdraw item:g` → suggests bank items starting with 'g'

### Interactive Inventory:
- `/inventory` now shows ephemeral message with use buttons
- Click "Use Bandage" button → executes `/use Bandage`
- Up to 25 items shown as interactive buttons

## Technical Implementation

- **Autocomplete Limit**: Discord limits to 25 suggestions per autocomplete
- **Case Insensitive**: All filtering is case insensitive
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data/errors
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and slicing of large inventories

All changes maintain existing functionality while adding the requested improvements. No breaking changes to existing command usage patterns.
