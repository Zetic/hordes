# DIE2NITE Discord Bot - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Recreate the experience of the original DIE2NITE (Hordes) browser game as a Discord bot, making it accessible to server members through slash commands while maintaining the core survival and community mechanics of the original.

## Game Analysis

### Original Game Core Mechanics

Based on analysis of the [original Hordes source code](https://github.com/motion-twin/WebGamesArchives/tree/main/Hordes), the game features:

1. **Survival Elements**
   - Daily water consumption requirement
   - Health/wound system
   - Multiple death causes (dehydration, zombie attacks, etc.)
   - Day/night cycle with zombie attacks

2. **Resource Management**
   - Wood, water, oil, and fusion materials
   - Tool/item system with various types (weapons, bags, furniture, etc.)
   - Inventory management with carrying capacity

3. **Zone-Based World**
   - City (safe zone with buildings)
   - Outside (dangerous exploration area)
   - Home (personal space)
   - Greater Outside (extended exploration)

4. **Community Features**
   - Shared city with defensive buildings
   - Community resource sharing
   - Collaborative building projects

5. **Exploration & Combat**
   - Grid-based map exploration
   - Random encounters and resource discovery
   - Zombie threats and combat mechanics
   - Risk vs reward gameplay

## Discord Adaptation Strategy

### Core Gameplay Adaptations

#### 1. **Real-Time Daily Cycles**
- **Original**: Real-time with automatic daily progression
- **Adaptation**: Real-time schedule with two distinct phases:
  - **Play Mode** (9:00pm–7:59pm next day): Players can freely perform in-game actions
  - **Horde Mode** (8:00pm–8:59pm): Players wait and see results of night attacks
- **Benefits**: Maintains the original's tension while working with Discord's nature

#### 2. **Text-Based Map System**
- **Original**: Visual 2D grid map
- **Adaptation**: ASCII/emoji grid representations in Discord embeds
- **Implementation**: 
  ```
  🏠🏠🌲🌲⚡
  🏠🏭🌲🌲🌲
  🏠🏥🚪🌲💧
  🏠🏦🌲🌲🌲
  🛡️🛡️🌲🌲🌲
  ```

#### 3. **Slash Command Interface**
- **Primary Actions**: `/explore`, `/build`, `/craft`, `/trade`, `/status`
- **Secondary Actions**: `/give`, `/attack`, `/rest`
- **Admin Commands**: `/advance-day`, `/trigger-event`, `/game-status`

### User Flow Design

#### New Player Onboarding
1. `/join` - Register as new survivor and join the town
2. Receive basic starting equipment
3. Begin playing immediately during Play Mode hours

#### Daily Player Routine
1. Check status with `/status` (health, water, inventory)
2. Plan actions based on remaining action points
3. Choose between:
   - `/explore` - Leave city to gather resources
   - `/build` - Contribute to city defenses
   - `/craft` - Create tools/items
   - `/social` - Interact with other players
4. Take actions during Play Mode hours (9:00pm–7:59pm next day)

#### City Management
1. Players collaborate on building defenses
2. Resource sharing through `/trade` and `/give`
3. Strategic planning for survival

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design

#### Core Tables
- **Players**: User ID, stats, inventory, location, status
- **Cities**: City data, buildings, defenses, population
- **Items**: Tool definitions, stats, effects
- **Maps**: Zone layouts, resource nodes, exploration status
- **Game_State**: Current day, phase, events, global settings

#### Key Entities
```sql
-- Players
CREATE TABLE players (
  discord_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  character_name VARCHAR(50),
  city_id INT,
  health INT,
  thirst INT,
  action_points INT,
  x_coord INT,
  y_coord INT,
  status VARCHAR(20), -- alive, dead, ghost
  last_active TIMESTAMP
);

-- Cities
CREATE TABLE cities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  defense_points INT,
  water_reserve INT,
  building_slots JSON,
  population_count INT,
  day_founded INT
);

-- Items/Tools
CREATE TABLE player_inventory (
  player_id BIGINT,
  item_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  condition_percent INT
);
```

### Discord Bot Architecture

#### Command Structure
```
/game
├── /join
├── /status [target_player]
├── /inventory [category]
└── /leave-game

/actions
├── /explore [direction] [distance]
├── /search [area_type]
├── /build [building_type]
├── /craft [item_name] [quantity]
├── /use [item_name] [target]

└── /city-info

/admin
├── /advance-day
├── /trigger-attack [intensity]
├── /spawn-event [event_type]
├── /game-stats
└── /reset-game
```

#### Bot Components
1. **Command Handler**: Process slash commands and route to appropriate modules
2. **Game Engine**: Core logic for action processing, validation, state changes
3. **Database Manager**: Handle all database operations with connection pooling
4. **Display Manager**: Format game state into Discord embeds and messages
5. **Event System**: Manage game events, timers, and automated processes

### State Management

#### Game Phases
1. **Play Mode** (9:00pm–7:59pm next day): Players can take actions, plan strategies
2. **Horde Mode** (8:00pm–8:59pm): Automated zombie attacks and night events processed
3. **Status Update**: Continuous updates to displays and game state

#### Persistence Strategy
- **Redis Cache**: Active game state, player sessions, temporary data
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent game data, player profiles, historical logs
- **File Storage**: Map templates, item definitions, configuration

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Multiplayer Coordination
**Problem**: Multiple players acting simultaneously in shared game state
**Solution**: 
- Action queuing system with validation
- Transaction-based database updates
- Clear action point economy to prevent conflicts

### Challenge 2: Real-time Communication
**Problem**: Discord's async nature vs game's need for coordination
**Solution**:
- Dedicated game channel for the town
- Thread-based private communications
- Clear Play Mode/Horde Mode schedule (9pm-8pm/8pm-9pm)

### Challenge 3: Visual Representation
**Problem**: Complex game state in text-only format
**Solution**:
- Rich embeds with emoji icons
- Consistent formatting standards
- Progressive disclosure (summary → detail views)

### Challenge 4: Game Balance
**Problem**: Adapting browser game balance for Discord's different pace
**Solution**:
- Adjustable action point economy
- Configurable game speed settings
- Playtesting with different group sizes

### Challenge 5: Data Persistence
**Problem**: Long-running games with persistent state
**Solution**:
- Robust backup systems
- Database migration strategies
- Game state export/import functionality

## Conclusion

The DIE2NITE Discord Bot represents an ambitious adaptation of a complex browser game to a new platform. Success will depend on carefully balancing faithfulness to the original experience with the practical constraints and opportunities of Discord's environment. The phased approach allows for iterative development and community feedback, ensuring the final product meets player expectations while being technically sustainable.

Key focus areas should be:
1. Intuitive command design that doesn't overwhelm new players
2. Robust technical architecture that can scale with success
3. Strong community features that leverage Discord's social nature
4. Flexible game systems that can adapt to different play styles and group sizes

With careful planning and execution, this project can create a unique and engaging gaming experience that brings the beloved DIE2NITE mechanics to a new generation of players on Discord.
