# DIE2NITE Discord Bot - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Recreate the experience of the original DIE2NITE (Hordes) browser game as a Discord bot, making it accessible to server members through slash commands while maintaining the core survival and community mechanics of the original.

## Game Analysis

### Original Game Core Mechanics

Based on analysis of the [original Hordes source code](https://github.com/motion-twin/WebGamesArchives/tree/main/Hordes), the game features:

1. **Survival Elements**
   - Daily water consumption requirement
   - Health/wound system
   - Multiple death causes (dehydration, zombie attacks, etc.)
   - Day/night cycle with zombie attacks

2. **Resource Management**
   - Wood, water, oil, and fusion materials
   - Tool/item system with various types (weapons, bags, furniture, etc.)
   - Inventory management with carrying capacity

3. **Zone-Based World**
   - City (safe zone with buildings)
   - Outside (dangerous exploration area)
   - Home (personal space)
   - Greater Outside (extended exploration)

4. **Community Features**
   - Shared city with defensive buildings
   - Elections for city leaders (Shaman, Guide)
   - Community resource sharing
   - Collaborative building projects

5. **Exploration & Combat**
   - Grid-based map exploration
   - Random encounters and resource discovery
   - Zombie threats and combat mechanics
   - Risk vs reward gameplay

## Discord Adaptation Strategy

### Core Gameplay Adaptations

#### 1. **Turn-Based Daily Cycles**
- **Original**: Real-time with automatic daily progression
- **Adaptation**: Turn-based rounds with admin-triggered day progressions
- **Benefits**: Better suited for Discord's async nature, allows for strategic planning

#### 2. **Text-Based Map System**
- **Original**: Visual 2D grid map
- **Adaptation**: ASCII/emoji grid representations in Discord embeds
- **Implementation**: 
  ```
  🏠🏠🌲🌲⚡
  🏠🏭🌲🌲🌲
  🏠🏥🚪🌲💧
  🏠🏦🌲🌲🌲
  🛡️🛡️🌲🌲🌲
  ```

#### 3. **Slash Command Interface**
- **Primary Actions**: `/explore`, `/build`, `/craft`, `/trade`, `/status`
- **Secondary Actions**: `/vote`, `/give`, `/attack`, `/rest`
- **Admin Commands**: `/advance-day`, `/trigger-event`, `/game-status`

### User Flow Design

#### New Player Onboarding
1. `/join-game` - Register as new survivor
2. Choose starting profession/stats
3. Receive starting equipment and tutorial
4. Assigned to existing city or help found new one

#### Daily Player Routine
1. Check status with `/status` (health, water, inventory)
2. Plan actions based on remaining action points
3. Choose between:
   - `/explore` - Leave city to gather resources
   - `/build` - Contribute to city defenses
   - `/craft` - Create tools/items
   - `/social` - Interact with other players
4. Prepare for night phase (zombie attacks)

#### City Management
1. Players collaborate on building defenses
2. Resource sharing through `/trade` and `/give`
3. Elections for leadership roles
4. Strategic planning for survival

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design

#### Core Tables
- **Players**: User ID, stats, inventory, location, status
- **Cities**: City data, buildings, defenses, population
- **Items**: Tool definitions, stats, effects
- **Maps**: Zone layouts, resource nodes, exploration status
- **Game_State**: Current day, phase, events, global settings

#### Key Entities
```sql
-- Players
CREATE TABLE players (
  discord_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  character_name VARCHAR(50),
  city_id INT,
  health INT,
  thirst INT,
  action_points INT,
  profession VARCHAR(20),
  x_coord INT,
  y_coord INT,
  status VARCHAR(20), -- alive, dead, ghost
  last_active TIMESTAMP
);

-- Cities
CREATE TABLE cities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  defense_points INT,
  water_reserve INT,
  building_slots JSON,
  population_count INT,
  day_founded INT
);

-- Items/Tools
CREATE TABLE player_inventory (
  player_id BIGINT,
  item_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  condition_percent INT
);
```

└── /reset-game
```

#### Bot Components
1. **Command Handler**: Process slash commands and route to appropriate modules
2. **Game Engine**: Core logic for action processing, validation, state changes
3. **Database Manager**: Handle all database operations with connection pooling
4. **Display Manager**: Format game state into Discord embeds and messages
5. **Event System**: Manage game events, timers, and automated processes

### State Management

#### Game Phases
1. **Planning Phase**: Players can take actions, plan strategies
2. **Resolution Phase**: All actions processed simultaneously
3. **Event Phase**: Random events, zombie attacks, resource depletion
4. **Status Phase**: Update displays, check win/lose conditions

#### Persistence Strategy
- **Redis Cache**: Active game state, player sessions, temporary data
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent game data, player profiles, historical logs
- **File Storage**: Map templates, item definitions, configuration

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Multiplayer Coordination
**Problem**: Multiple players acting simultaneously in shared game state
**Solution**: 
- Action queuing system with validation
- Transaction-based database updates
- Clear action point economy to prevent conflicts

### Challenge 2: Real-time Communication
**Problem**: Discord's async nature vs game's need for coordination
**Solution**:
- Dedicated game channels per city
- Thread-based private communications
- Scheduled "action phases" with time limits

### Challenge 3: Visual Representation
**Problem**: Complex game state in text-only format
**Solution**:
- Rich embeds with emoji icons
- Consistent formatting standards
- Progressive disclosure (summary → detail views)

### Challenge 4: Game Balance
**Problem**: Adapting browser game balance for Discord's different pace
**Solution**:
- Adjustable action point economy
- Configurable game speed settings
- Playtesting with different group sizes

### Challenge 5: Data Persistence
**Problem**: Long-running games with persistent state
**Solution**:
- Robust backup systems
- Database migration strategies
- Game state export/import functionality
